    We start with a meeting via phone, skype, etc. I need to understand the big picture of what you're trying to achieve. If it feels necessary and/or appropriate, the next step might be my signing an NDA for you so that we can move into specifics.
  <br />
  <br />
    If you already have created a specification and/or design docs for your project, I'd next need to go over those, followed by a discussion about them in which I will draw out any specifics that might not be included in your documents (or, assist you in creating such documents-- blue prints, for your project).
  <br />
  <br />
    Once I've formed a clear understanding of what is to be built, and we've discussed timelines, I next will offer you a quote on production. I don't bill by the hour. Instead, I break things into benchmarks / milestones. I start development on one of my servers, and give you access to it, during the project as it's built. If during development, you see something that needs changing, or you want to make an addition, being able to see what we're building as it's being done makes for much quicker work.
  <br />
  <br />
    When I feel I've achieved a milestone, you go over it to your satisfaction. Once you've accepted it, when your method of payment clears my bank, I move that portion of the source code to your repository.
